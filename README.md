# Landing Page - The Odin Project

This is a solution to the [Landing Page project from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The goal was to recreate a specific web design using **Flexbox** and clean HTML/CSS.

## Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Key Learnings
During this project, I learned how to:
- Use the **Container Pattern** to handle full-width backgrounds with centered content.
- Master Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-shrink`.
- Handle **CSS Margin Collapse** effectively.
- Structure semantic HTML for a landing page (Hero, Info, CTA, Footer).
